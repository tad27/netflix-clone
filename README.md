# Netflix Clone with React JS and Tailwind CSS :heart:

This Netflix Clone is a simple dummy project that I built only to imporve my web development skills. The application allows users to browse and search for movies and TV shows, and provides a similar user interface to Netflix. This project was built using React, Tailwind, and the TMDB API.
I also used Firbase for authentication.
